    <h1>Fried Bologna Sandwich</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Before you begin, wash your hands thoroughly with
      warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. Clean your workspace and
      gather all ingredients and materialss.
    </p>
    <p>Adult supervision is recommended for younger and inexperienced cooks.</p>

    <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Small frying pan</li>
      <li>Butter knife or table knife</li>
      <li>Spatula (optional but helpful)</li>
      <li>Plate for assembling sandwich</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 slices of white bread (or preferred sandwich bread)</li>
      <li>1–2 slices of bologna (thicker slices may need more cooking time)</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon cooking oil (vegetable, canola, or olive oil)</li>
      <li>1 slice of American cheese (white or yellow)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon mustard (yellow or Dijon)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a small frying pan on a stove burner. Make sure the burner is off
        before placing the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the burner on to medium heat. Allow the pan to warm up for about 1
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/8 teaspoon of oil to the pan and gently swirl to coat the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a butter knife, make a small cut from the center of the bologna
        slice to the edge. This helps prevent it from curling while cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully place the bologna slice(s) into the heated pan. Use a spatula
        if needed to avoid touching the hot pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the bologna for about 2–3 minutes on the first side, until it
        starts to brown slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the bologna using a spatula and cook the other side for another 2–3
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the second side is browning, place the slice of cheese on top of
        the bologna to melt slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the bologna finishes cooking, lay out the two slices of bread on a
        plate. Use the butter knife to spread mustard on one side of each slice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the bologna is browned and the cheese is slightly melted, turn off
        the burner and carefully remove the bologna from the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the hot bologna and cheese onto one slice of mustard-covered
        bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with the second slice of bread, mustard side down, to complete the
        sandwich.
      </li>
      <li>Let the sandwich cool for 1–2 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <em>Optional:</em> You can toast the bread in the pan for extra crunch, or
      add toppings like pickles, lettuce, or tomato for a twist.
