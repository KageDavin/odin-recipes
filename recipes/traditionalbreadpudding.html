    <h1>Traditional Bread Pudding</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Before you begin, wash your hands thoroughly with
      warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. Clean your workspace and
      gather all ingredients and materialss.
    </p>
    <p>Adult supervision is recommended for younger and inexperienced cooks.</p>

    <h3>Materials Needed:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5-quart casserole dish (or similar oven-safe baking dish)</li>
      <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
      <li>Whisk or fork</li>
      <li>Measuring cups and spoons</li>
      <li>Oven mitts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 cups bread, cubed (day-old buns, sandwich bread, or rolls work well)
      </li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups milk (whole milk preferred for richness)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>Lightly grease the casserole dish with butter or non-stick spray.</li>
      <li>
        Cut or tear bread into bite-sized cubes and place evenly into the
        casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, melted butter,
        sugar, and cinnamon until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly pour the mixture over the bread cubes, making sure all pieces are
        soaked. Press down gently with a spoon or spatula to help the bread
        absorb the liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the mixture sit for 5–10 minutes to fully absorb (optional but
        recommended for better texture).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 40–45 minutes, or
        until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes
        out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove from the oven using oven mitts and allow to cool for
        10–15 minutes before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy warm, optionally topped with whipped cream, vanilla sauce, or a
        sprinkle of powdered sugar!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <em>Tip:</em> You can add raisins, chopped apples, or a splash of vanilla
      extract to the mixture for extra flavor.
    </p>
